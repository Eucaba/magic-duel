## MAGIC DUEL!
## A C# Console Application that offers a little game, emulating a magic duel between a wizard and a warlock.

Currently I'm learning C#, and I came up with this little project as an exercise to review my notes. I hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š

### App requirements ðŸ“Œ
One player app.

Characters (wizard/warlock) randomly assigned.

Alternating turns between both characters until one of them deceases.

The player can choose whether to heal themselves or attack the opponent during their turn.

The game announces if the player wins or loses.


### Possible improvements to implement in the future ðŸš§
Improve visuals (make text more user friendly)

Adjust health/attacks/healing to make the game shorter and avoid it being boring

Personalize attacks and healing method according to the character


### Instructions to launch the game:
1. dotnet build TestProject.csproj
2. dotnet run TestProject.csproj
3. Enjoy! ðŸª„
